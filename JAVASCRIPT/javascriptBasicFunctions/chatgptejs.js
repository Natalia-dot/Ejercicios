/*Certainly! Here are some exercises that involve working with arrays and objects:
Exercise 1: Counting Occurrences

Write a function countOccurrences that takes an array of elements and returns an 
object containing the count of each unique element. */

const elements = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"];
const countsArr = []
// Output: { apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 1 }
// countsArr = [{element: --, count: --}]

const countOccurrences = () => {
array.forEach((element, index)=> {
    
});
